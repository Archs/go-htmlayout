HTMLayout is a fast, lightweight, and embeddable HTML/CSS rendering component for Windows.\r\n\r\n### Project status\r\nGo-htmlayout is written for Go1.  Most of the HTMLayout API has been wrapped (especially dom element related stuff), but there is still more of the HTMLayout API that I haven't tackled yet.  Tests are also incomplete at this point.  In short, this wrapper is probably not ready for serious production use.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nClone the repo.  In the main directory of the repository, run the following to fetch the latest version of HTMLayout:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython get_htmlayout.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough the tests provide an example of how to get started using gohl, there are probably better examples of window creation/management elsewhere on the internet.\r\n"}
